## 📋 About This Index

This index serves as your entry point to understanding the architectural decisions that shape this audio transcription system. Each Architecture Decision Record (ADR) documents important choices made during development, providing context, rationale, and consequences.

> [!TIP]
> If you're new to ADRs, they document "why" decisions were made, not just "what" was implemented. This helps future developers understand the reasoning behind the architecture.

## 📖 How to Use ADRs

**For New Contributors:**
1. Start with the [New Developer Path](#-new-developer-path)
2. Read ADRs relevant to your work area
3. Reference ADRs when making related decisions
4. Propose new ADRs for significant architectural changes

**For Experienced Developers:**
1. Use the [Quick Reference](#-quick-reference) to find relevant ADRs
2. Check "Related ADRs" sections for context
3. Ensure your implementation aligns with documented decisions
4. Update ADRs when implementation differs from the decision

**For Creating New ADRs:**
1. Use the [ADR Template](ADR-TEMPLATE_STANDARD.md)
2. Follow the numbering scheme and categorization
3. Include proper cross-references to related decisions
4. Ensure the decision addresses a real architectural question

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ADRs are living documents. When implementation differs from the documented decision, update the ADR or create a new one that supersedes it.
