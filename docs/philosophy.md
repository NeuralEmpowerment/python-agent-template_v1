# 🧠 Project Philosophy

This document outlines the core philosophy and principles that guide our experimental projects.

## 📊 Experimentation Over Perfection

- **Experiment Rapidly**: We prioritize running multiple small experiments over perfecting a single approach
- **Embrace Failure**: Failed experiments provide valuable insights and are considered successful outcomes
- **Learn, Document, Iterate**: Document learnings from each experiment to inform future work

## 🔧 Developer Experience First

- **Turnkey Setup**: Any project should be installable with a single command (`scripts/setup.sh`)
- **Self-documenting**: Projects should clearly document how to use them in the README and provide helpful CLI feedback
- **Consistent Interfaces**: Standardized commands across projects reduce cognitive load

## 🏗️ Just Enough Architecture

- **Lightweight Patterns**: Use just enough architecture to enable rapid iteration without overengineering
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organize code by domain concepts, even in small experiments
- **Ready to Scale**: Design experiments so successful ones can evolve into production systems

## 🧩 Composable and Reusable

- **Extract Patterns**: Identify and extract reusable patterns across experiments
- **Modular Design**: Build experiments as compositions of well-defined components
- **Template-Driven**: Create templates for common project types to accelerate new experiments

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

- **Refine Processes**: Continuously improve our experimental workflows based on feedback
- **Share Knowledge**: Document learnings and patterns in ADRs and shared documentation
- **Cross-pollinate**: Apply insights from one domain to problems in another
