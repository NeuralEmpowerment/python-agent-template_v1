## 🎯 Vision

**Goal:** Complete infrastructure automation that enables push-button environment creation, deployment, and testing across all environments from development to production.

**Core Principles:**
- **Infrastructure as Code** - All infrastructure defined in version-controlled code
- **Environment Parity** - Consistent environments across dev, staging, production
- **Push-Button Deployment** - Single command environment creation and updates
- **Automated Testing** - Infrastructure and application testing in isolated environments
- **Disaster Recovery** - Quick environment recreation and backup/restore procedures

**Ultimate Target:**
```bash
# Single command to create complete environment
ansible-playbook deploy.yml -e env=production -e version=v1.3.0

# Single command to run tests in isolated environment  
ansible-playbook test.yml -e test_suite=integration -e version=v1.3.0-alpha.1
```

## 🛠️ Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Install Ansible
pip install ansible

# Install Docker
# Platform-specific installation

# Install required Ansible collections
ansible-galaxy collection install community.docker
ansible-galaxy collection install community.postgresql
```

**Initial Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Create ansible directory structure
mkdir -p ansible/{inventories,playbooks,roles,group_vars,host_vars}

# 2. Initialize basic inventory
echo "localhost ansible_connection=local" > ansible/inventories/development/hosts

# 3. Create basic development playbook
# (See examples above)

# 4. Test basic functionality
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/development.yml -i ansible/inventories/development/hosts
```

**Current Manual Process (Temporary):**
```bash
# Until automation is complete, use manual process
make dev          # Setup and start development
make qa           # Quality assurance
make docker-build # Build Docker image
make docker-run   # Run in Docker
```

> [!NOTE]
> This infrastructure strategy supports both current manual development and future automated deployments, providing a clear evolution path from development to enterprise-grade operations.
