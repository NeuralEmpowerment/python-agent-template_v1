## 🎯 Key Concepts

**Core Architectural Patterns:**
- **Bounded Contexts** - Self-contained business domains that can become microservices
- **Domain-Driven Design** - Business logic separate from infrastructure concerns
- **Repository Pattern** - Abstract data access with multiple implementations
- **Entity-First Database** - Python domain entities drive database schema
- **Application Services** - Coordinate business workflows across domains

**Development Principles:**
- **Selective Git Staging** - NEVER use `git add .`, always review and stage selectively
- **Quality-First** - All commits must pass `make qa` before being committed
- **Makefile Automation** - Standardized development commands for all tasks
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Push-button environments and automated testing

**Microservice Evolution:**
- **Start Monolithic** - Rapid development in single repository
- **Bounded Context Isolation** - Each context can be extracted independently
- **Clean Boundaries** - No cross-context dependencies or shared state
- **Gradual Extraction** - Move contexts to microservices when business boundaries become clear
